# CCTV - DF Layer: A Forensic Integrity Add-On for CCTV Logs and Footage

CCTV - DF Layer is a digital forensics system developed for **educational purposes**. It is designed to securely acquire, log, and verify CCTV footage while maintaining data integrity and chain-of-custody, providing students with hands-on experience in applied digital forensics.

Developed by **Computer Science students**, this project combines academic learning with practical implementation of digital forensics concepts inspired by real-world CCTV systems.

## 🎯 Purpose
The main goals of CCTV - DF Layer are to:

- Demonstrate secure acquisition of CCTV footage without altering the original data
- Maintain detailed logs and metadata for all evidence collected
- Ensure data integrity and verify authenticity to support investigative learning
- Serve as a foundation for further exploration and improvement in digital forensics

## ⚙️ Features
- Secure evidence acquisition from CCTV systems
- Logging of all actions performed on the footage
- Verification of data integrity to detect tampering
- Structured project architecture for easy expansion and experimentation
- User-friendly interface designed for targeted users

## 📚 Educational Context
This project is a collaborative effort to learn and demonstrate digital forensics techniques in a controlled, academic environment. It is **not intended for commercial or real-world legal use**.  
This project is also a **continuous work in progress**, with improvements and new features planned as part of the learning process.
